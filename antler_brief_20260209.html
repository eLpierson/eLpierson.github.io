    <!-- ELEVATOR PITCH -->
    <h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <div class="card highlight">
      <p>Homebuyers get inspection reports but don't know how to act on them. What's urgent? What does it cost? Who to call? Right now, real estate agents fill that gap manually - but it's not their job, and it doesn't scale.</p>
      <p>We're building an AI-driven platform that solves both sides: helps buyers prioritize and connect with contractors, and gives agents a tool to automate what they're already doing while enhancing their trusted relationship with the client.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0"><strong>The unlock:</strong> For the first time, we're capturing the contractor recommendations agents have been making for years - the trusted word-of-mouth rolodex that no one in the industry has ever digitized. That's the moat.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- WHY THIS IS BIG -->
    <h2>Why This Is Big</h2>
    <div class="stat-row">
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">$45B</span>
        <span class="label">Annual work from inspection reports (US)</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">$2T+</span>
        <span class="label">US construction industry</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">#1</span>
        <span class="label">Competitor to every contractor marketplace: trusted word-of-mouth recommendations</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The biggest competitor to HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, and Angi isn't another platform - it's the <strong>agent's personal rolodex and other word-of-mouth referrals</strong>. Nobody has digitized that. We are.</p>

    <!-- LIFECYCLE PLAY -->
    <h2>The Full Lifecycle Play</h2>
    <p>The platform is <strong>branded for the agent</strong>, creating a relationship lifecycle that doesn't exist today:</p>
    <div class="lifecycle">
      <div class="lifecycle-step">
        <span class="step-num">1</span>
        <span class="step-title">Post-Inspection</span>
        <span class="step-desc">Buyer gets report. Platform triages, estimates costs, matches with trusted contractors from agent's network.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="lifecycle-step">
        <span class="step-num">2</span>
        <span class="step-title">Homeownership</span>
        <span class="step-desc">Things break over time. Buyer returns to the platform - still connected to their agent.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="lifecycle-step">
        <span class="step-num">3</span>
        <span class="step-title">Pre-Sale</span>
        <span class="step-desc">Ready to sell? Tons of prep work. Another contractor matching moment. Agent is top of mind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="lifecycle-step">
        <span class="step-num">4</span>
        <span class="step-title">Sale</span>
        <span class="step-desc">Homeowner uses the same agent for the sale - instead of forgetting or going with someone else.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This solves a real agent problem: <strong>client retention over the 7-10 year homeownership cycle</strong> - something no one has cracked.</p>

    <!-- RECENT PROGRESS -->
    <h2>What Changed in the Last Few Weeks</h2>

    <h3>Demand Signal Accelerated</h3>
    <div class="stat-row">
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">1 → ~7</span>
        <span class="label">Potentially committed agent leads</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">4 → ~10</span>
        <span class="label">Agents helping design the product</span>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-box">
        <span class="number">+2</span>
        <span class="label">New personas identified (property manager, buyer-investor)</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Product Progress</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed critical cost estimation accuracy (was 10-20x inflated; still fixing some inflation with number of issues found)</li>
      <li>Agent onboarding + buyer invite flow merged</li>
      <li>AI summary dashboard, negotiation recommendations, trusted contractors, contractor assignment - all in flight</li>
      <li>Full MVP scoped: 8 epics, 25 user stories</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 completed market research deliverables</li>
      <li>Deep persona and JTBD work across buyer, agent, and contractor</li>
      <li>Interview guides built and being used in live conversations</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- HONEST ASSESSMENT -->
    <h2>Honest Assessment</h2>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div class="card green">
        <h3>What I'm Confident In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem is real - 100% of agents interviewed confirming independently, already doing this manually</li>
          <li>The rolodex moat is defensible - relationship data that compounds, and agents are motivated to build it</li>
          <li>The lifecycle play gives us multiple revenue moments per customer, not just one</li>
          <li>Blue ocean - not aware of anyone building for the agent-as-distribution-channel model</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card amber">
        <h3>What I'm Less Sure About</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Contractor willingness to pay and at what price point</li>
          <li>Agent adoption friction - will they use a platform vs. texting their guy?</li>
          <li>Which persona drives scale faster - individual agents, teams, brokerages, or the new PM/investor personas?</li>
          <li>Defensibility at scale - if this works, what stops Zillow or Realtor.com from building it?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- QUESTIONS -->
    <h2>Questions for You</h2>

    <div class="question-group">
      <h3>On Market &amp; Scale</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We're entering through a $45B post-inspection wedge into a $2T+ construction industry. Does the wedge-to-platform expansion story hold for you, or do you see a tighter/better framing?</li>
        <li>The new property manager and investor personas represent repeat, high-frequency usage vs. the one-time homebuyer. Have you seen marketplaces successfully layer B2B repeat users on top of a consumer wedge? What breaks?</li>
        <li>What's your pattern match on "digitizing the rolodex"? Has anyone successfully captured word-of-mouth referral networks in other industries? What worked and what didn't?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="question-group">
      <h3>On GTM &amp; Distribution</h3>
      <ol start="4">
        <li>Our GTM is agent-led - agents adopt the platform, invite their buyers, and build their contractor network on it. Is that too narrow at this stage, or is that the right level of focus?</li>
        <li>How do you think about the sequencing: individual agents → teams → brokerages? Or should we go straight to brokerages for scale?</li>
        <li>We have ~7 agent leads and ~10 agents helping shape the product. What signal would you look for to know this has legs before committing heavier resources?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="question-group">
      <h3>On Business Model</h3>
      <ol start="7">
        <li>Contractors paying per lead is one obvious model, but the agent's rolodex is the real asset. Is there a better monetization angle? We think about things like subscription, transaction fee, data licensing. Thoughts?</li>
        <li>The pre-sale market (homeowners getting the house ready to sell) could be as big as post-inspection. Should we validate that in parallel or stay sequenced?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="question-group">
      <h3>On Blind Spots</h3>
      <ol start="9">
        <li>What are we not seeing? What kills companies like this at this stage?</li>
        <li>The lifecycle retention play (keeping agents top of mind for 7-10 years) is compelling in theory. Is there evidence that digital tools actually change that consumer behavior, or is it wishful thinking?</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- BIGGER PICTURE -->
    <h2>Bigger Picture: Things We're Thinking About</h2>

    <h3>Data Products and the "Equifax for Homes" Opportunity</h3>
    <div class="card highlight">
      <p>Every inspection report we process is rich with structured data that nobody is aggregating today. From photos alone, we can identify appliance types, ages, and conditions - furnaces, water heaters, HVAC units, roofing materials, electrical panels, and more. Across thousands of reports, this becomes a detailed home condition rating based on count and severity of issues.</p>
      <p>Think of it as an <strong>Equifax for homes</strong> - an objective, data-driven condition score. Who would want this? Insurance companies pricing risk, lenders underwriting mortgages, investors evaluating properties, municipalities tracking housing stock, and home warranty providers targeting the right customers. This is a long-term play, but the data starts accumulating from day one.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Objective Contractor Ratings (Before and After)</h3>
    <div class="card highlight">
      <p>Right now, contractor ratings across every platform are subjective - based on how a homeowner is feeling, their mood, and vibes. A contractor could do excellent work and still get a mediocre review because the homeowner was stressed about something else entirely.</p>
      <p>We have something no one else does: the <strong>before picture from the inspection report</strong>. If we capture an after picture of how the job went, we can create a more objective quality rating based on actual work performed against documented conditions. This gives contractors a genuinely differentiated value prop - a rating system that reflects their craftsmanship, not just customer sentiment.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Homeowner's Own Rolodex</h3>
    <div class="card highlight">
      <p>The agent's trusted contractor network seeds the platform at the start of the journey. But over time, during the homeownership years, the homeowner will inevitably collect their own trusted contractor recommendations - from neighbors, friends, coworkers, local community groups.</p>
      <p>The platform becomes <strong>their hub</strong>. They can add their own trusted contractors to their profile and use them over time. This does two things: it deepens individual engagement with the platform, and it feeds back into the broader trusted rolodex in a more robust, community-driven way. The network of trust grows from both the top (agent) and the bottom (homeowner) simultaneously.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- WHAT I NEED -->
    <h2>What We Need Help With</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul class="help-list">
        <li><strong>Pattern matching</strong> - What does this remind you of? Where have you seen the "digitize the trusted referral" play work or fail?</li>
        <li><strong>Introductions</strong> - Proptech investors, brokerage operators, anyone who's built agent-facing tools</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure testing the moat</strong> - Is the rolodex data truly defensible, or does it commoditize once captured?</li>
        <li><strong>Scale path clarity</strong> - Agent-by-agent vs. brokerage-level deals, and when to make that transition</li>
        <li><strong>Blind spots we don't know we have</strong> - If something's broken, we'd rather find it now.</li>
